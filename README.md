 5. Click **Add** and you're done!
 
 If you don't see **Remote Triggers**, you are running an old version of Triggernometry. Download the latest update from [https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry/releases/](https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry/releases/).

<!-- ### Known Issues
 - Main repository folder `Github` occasionally gets disabled after a new upload.
 - Some disabled folders/triggers becomes enabled after uploading to the repository.

## What's in it?
Triggers within the repository are separated by content folders. Most stuff are enabled by default. Disable triggers that you don't want activated. That is all!
