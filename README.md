***NOTE:*** *This repository uses triggers that rely on the `MapEffect` custom log line. You will need OverlayPlugin [v0.19.5](https://github.com/OverlayPlugin/OverlayPlugin/releases/tag/v0.19.5 "OverlayPlugin v0.19.5") or [later](https://github.com/OverlayPlugin/OverlayPlugin/releases "later") for them to work.*

## How to Setup

 1. Navigate to your Triggernometry plugin tab in ACT.
 2. Right-click on **Remote Triggers** and choose **Add** > **Repository** from the list.
 3. Name it whatever you want but put the following in the address:
 ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexxiesia/xiv_triggernometry/master/Triggernometry_Lexxie.xml```
 4. Under the **Update and Permissions** section, make sure your settings are as follows:

 5. Click **Add** and you're done!
 
 If you don't see **Remote Triggers**, you are running an old version of Triggernometry. Download the latest update from Triggernometry's [GitHub page](https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry/releases/latest "GitHub page").
